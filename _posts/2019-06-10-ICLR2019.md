- **BA-Net: Dense Bundle Adjustment Networks**
    ```
    Problem: Structure from motion
    Method: feature-metric bundle adjustment
    ```
- **Deterministic Variational Inference for Robust Bayesian Neural Networks**
    ```
    Problem: Argue that variational inference in neural networks is fragile
    Innovations: 
        1、novel deterministic method 
        2、hierarchical prior for parameters and  a procedure automatically selecting prior variances
    ```
